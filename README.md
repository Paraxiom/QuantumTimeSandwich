QuantumTimeSandwich
Overview

QuantumTimeSandwich is a comprehensive simulation platform integrating advanced quantum algorithms with cryptographic techniques. Developed in collaboration with Cryptonique, it aims to advance the fields of quantum computing and encryption.
Project Structure

The QuantumTimeSandwich project consists of multiple subdirectories, each representing a separate crate with its own set of functionalities, examples, tests, and benchmarks.

    Examples: basis_selection_demo, bb84_aes_integration, bb84_simulation, eavesdropping_demo, lattice_crypto_demo, lwe-demo, ring-lwe-demo
    Commands:

    bash

    cd bb84/
    cargo run --example [example_name]
    cargo test
    cargo bench
